# Random Maze Generator and Q-Learning Navigation Model


This project was the result of a group project during my time in KSU's Machine Learning.

The group was tasked with creating a machine learning algorithm for a drone to solve a randomly generated maze. 
A program was created in Python that would generate a random maze with a goal state. 
An algorithm would then attempt to solve the maze through the use of a Q-Learning Model. 

The maze would also be solved by Breadth First Search Algorithm and an A* Search Heuristic algorithm. 
The results of these algorithms would be printed to the console for comparison.
